# chainedQueueTimeSimulator.py

This generator makes timestamps following an exponential distribution close to times that are divisible by 30.
Simulating the arrival of entities in a system where the time schedules are marked within 30 minutes

# weightedIntervalGenerator.py
This generator allows setting a certain quantity of windows with weights, timestamps are generated following the defined weights, where high weights are equal to more frequency
and low weights to a lower frequency
